## What We Collect
Nothing. Brutus does not collect, store, or share your personal information.

## What Others Collect
When you add feeds or refresh podcasts, requests are sent directly to the podcast host. Those servers may log standard request info (like your IP address) according to their own policies. Brutus does not control or store that data.  

Brutus ships with a suggested OPML file for convenience. You choose which feeds to add. If any suggested feed is a problem, let me know and I’ll adjust.

## On Your Device
- RSS feed URLs you add  
- Downloaded episodes and metadata  
- Your listening preferences and progress  

This data stays local unless you choose to sync with iCloud.

## Future Sync & Services
In future versions, you may optionally enable iCloud sync via Apple’s CloudKit. That data remains private to you and is not accessible to us.  

If we ever add a Brutus-hosted service, it will be opt-in and covered by a separate privacy notice.

## Network Requests
Brutus only makes network requests to:  
- Fetch podcast feeds from URLs you provide  
- Download episodes you choose to play  

## Children
Brutus is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect any information from them.

## Changes
We may update this policy. If we do, we’ll update the "Last updated" date at the top.
